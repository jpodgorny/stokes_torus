Version
=================

Version 2.0.

This version contains major updates on allowing different ionization states
of the torus, extension to elliptical torus geometry (while preserving circular
torus option), different source types (anisotropy and polarisation), extension
to 0.1-100 keV range, adding phenomenological primary radiation for unobscured
configurations, and providing several helpful quantities using the XSET command
in XSPEC.

Refer to Podgorný J. (2025) regarding all updates in this release.


Model description
=================

This 0.1-100 keV model computes the emission and its polarisation properties
from an X-ray source of power-law emission of arbitrary incident polarisation
that is reprocessed in axially symmetric structures. The reprocessing
is precomputed in a form of FITS fits files that are required for
usage. These files were computed for three different states
of incident polarisation for isotropic illumination, allowing
interpolation for any primary polarisation state; and one predefined
anisotropic polarisation and anisotropic angular distribution of
illumination, characteristic of a slab corona (for more details, see
Podgorný J., 2025). In addition it possesses other properties of the
local reprocessing tables that were precomputed for partially ionized
disc reflection (Podgorný J. et al., 2022), as well as fully neutral
disc reflection (Podgorný J., 2025). Option to reflect from a fully
ionized surface with 100% albedo and polarization predictions according
to the diffuse Chandrasekhar's electron-scattering atmosphere is allowed.

In the case of stokes_torus, reflection is calculated from an optically
thick elliptical or circular torus, representing e.g. an opaque AGN torus,
broad-line region, or a super-Eddington accretion funnel or optically thick
wind, illuminated by a central hot X-ray corona. More details on the
reflection model that was computed using the routine torus_integrator.py are
given in Podgorný J. et al. (2024) and Podgorný J. (2025). Apart from the
incident power-law index Gamma and its polarisation degree and angle, the
model then also depends on the cosine of observer's inclination angle, the
transformed half-opening angle of the torus (see Podgorný J. et al., 2024,
for details, or below), the skew of the inner walls, the ionization parameter
xi0 at the inner edge of the torus, the ionization profile's power-law index
beta, the position angle on the sky, and the overall redshift. The primary
radiation can be added with a switch N_p, if the source is not obscured. No
relativistic effects inside the system are taken into account. All components
are static. The central source is a point-like emission. The output is
normalized according to the inner torus distance from the center, the
distance to the source, and the expected density at the inner edge.
Several helpful parameters can be obtained from the model via the XSET
command (see below).

CAUTION: the model is currently public in a limited version with low resolution
in the reprocessing parameters. In the future, we aim to update it with higher
resolution in "rhorhoin" (par4), "xi0" (par5), "beta" (par6), and we aim to make
it accordingly better optimized for memory usage. Currently, the model loads
different precomputed tables for different values of "beta" (only beta = -2,
2, 6 are allowed and this parameter should not be fitted). In order to prevent
extensive memory consumption, one should not switch between different discrete
"beta" values within a single XSPEC session, as new tables are added to the
allocated memory each time after a switch. The same holds for switching between
"xi0" < 0, 0 < "xi0" < 5, and "xi0" >= 5; however within these three ranges one
can interpolate and fit without extra memory consumption. The same holds for
switching between "rhorhoin" = -1 and 1 <= "rhorhoin" <= 2; however within
the second mode one can interpolate and fit without extra memory consumption.
The same holds for switching between "pol_deg" = -1 and 0 <= "pol_deg" <= 1;
however within the second mode one can interpolate and fit without extra
memory consumption. In the future, we would like to restore the B switch
that allows to remove reflection below the torus equator. Currently, all
configurations are computed for B = 1 (with reflection from below the equator
included, which matters only for polarization in certain regions of the
parameter space).

Model parameters
================

* **par1 ... PhoIndex** 
  - photon index of the primary power-law X-ray flux
* **par2 ... cos_incl** 
  - cosine of the observer inclination (1.-pole, 0.-disc); with XSET one
    can recalculate to inclination in degrees
* **par3 ... trTheta**  
  - transformed torus half-opening angle between all allowed values per
    inclination and per rho (see Podgorný J. et al. 2024, Podgorný J.,
    2025); with XSET one can recalculate to Theta in degrees
* **par4 ... rhorhoin**
  - the skew rho, in the units of rho_in, of the inner walls of the torus
    -  1 <= rhorhoin <= 2: elliptical torus geometry, one can interpolate
       in rhorhoin
    -  = -1: circular torus geometry enforced: rho = rho_c (see Podgorný J.,
       2025), should be kept frozen
* **par5 ... xi0**
  - the ionization parameter in erg cm s^{-1} at the inner-most ring of
    the torus in the equatorial plane
    -  xi0 >= 5 - it uses the local reflection STOKES tables for partial ionization
    -  0 < xi0 < 5 - it assumes fully neutral reflection and uses the fully neutral
       local reflection STOKES tables
    -  xi0 < 0 - it assumes fully ionized reflection with 100% albedo and uses
       Chandrasekhar's diffuse reflection prescription; in this case the model is
       renormalized to X-ray luminosity between 10^(-1.1) and 10^(2.4) keV via
       the real inner-edge ionization parameter being equal to "-xi0" and via
       L_X = -xi0 * n_H0 * (rho_in)^2 for a constant density profile with radius,
       where n_H0 = 10^{15} cm^{-3} as for the table reprocessing and rho_in is
       the distance between the torus and the center;
  - with XSET you can calculate L_{2-10 keV} luminosity in erg/s and rho_in in pc,
    provided the norm value, expected n_H0 value and D_Mpc distance to the source
    (variables  "NORMVAL", "D_MPC" in Mpc and "NH0"  in cm^{-3}), if additionally
    the central object's mass is provided in XSET (variable "MASS" in M_sun), then
    rho_in in r_g is calculated
* **par6 ... beta**
  - the power-law index for the ionization parameter profile across the surface
    with distance from the source (see Podgorný J., 2025):
    xi = xi0 * a0 * mu_i * (rho_in / r)^(beta) ; this parameter is a proxy for
    density profile; keep it frozen at 2 for a constant density across the surface;
    do not interpolate in this parameter, use only -2, 2, 6 values and do not switch
    between them within one XSPEC session to prevent excesive memory allocation
* **par7 ... NpNr**
  - a switch between
    -  = 1 - reflection + primary
    -  = 0 - reflection only;
    the primary is only visible if inclination < Theta (the source is unobscured)
    and maybe switched off if combined in XSPEC with a less phenomenological model
    of the Comptonized emission; one can obtain the flux reflection fraction
    with XSET
* **par8 ... pol_deg**
  - anisotropy and intrinsic polarisation degree of the primary radiation
    -  0 <= pol_deg <= 1 - polarisation degree of isotropic central emission
    -  = -1 - a particular prescription for anisotropy and polarisation of a
       slab corona (similar to a typical lamp-post polarisation anisotropy
       profile) from Model B of Poutanen et al. 2023 (see Podgorný J., 2025, for
       details); keep par8 frozen, then par9 is not used for this configuration
* **par9 ... chi**
  - intrinsic polarisation angle (in degrees, -90 < chi < 90) of primary radiation
  - the orientation is degenarate by 180 degrees
* **par10 ... pos_ang**
  - orientation of the system (in degrees, -90 < pos_ang < 90),
  - the orientation is degenarate by 180 degrees
* **par11 ... zshift**
  - overall redshift
* **par12 ... Stokes**
  - defines the output of the model:
    - -1: the output is defined according to the XFLT0001 keyword of the 
          SPECTRUM extension of the data file, where "Stokes:0" means photon 
          number density flux, "Stokes:1" means Stokes parameter Q devided by 
          energy and "Stokes:2" means Stokes parameter U devided by energy
    -  0: array of photon number density flux per bin (array of Stokes parameter 
          I devided by energy) with the polarisation computations switched off
    -  1: array of photon number density flux per bin (array of Stokes parameter 
          I devided by energy), with the polarisation computations switched on
    -  2: array of Stokes parameter Q devided by energy
    -  3: array of Stokes parameter U devided by energy
    -  4: array of Stokes parameter V devided by energy
    -  5: array of degree of polarisation
    -  6: array of polarisation angle &psi;=0.5*atan(U/Q)
    -  7: array of "Stokes" angle 
          &beta; = 0.5*asin(V/sqrt(Q<sup>2</sup>+U<sup>2</sup>+V<sup>2</sup>))
    -  8: array of Stokes parameter Q devided by I
    -  9: array of Stokes parameter U devided by I
    - 10: array of Stokes parameter V devided by I
* **par13 ... norm**
  - equal to (100*rho_in_pc/D_Mpc)^2 * (n_H0/1e15) where rho_in is the physical
    distance between the center and the torus in pc, D_Mpc is the distance to the
    source in Mpc, and n_H0 is the expected density at the inner edge of the torus
    in cm^{-3};
  - with XSET you can obtain 2-10 keV luminosity in erg/s for a given norm (re-enter
    the norm value as XSET variable "NORMVAL") and D_Mpc in Mpc (XSET variable
    "D_MPC"); and additionally rho_in in pc for a given expected n_H0 in cm^{-3}
    (XSET variable "NH0") and rho_in in r_g, provided additionally the central
    object's mass (XSET variable "MASS" in M_sun)
  - should be frozen to unity in case the par12 (Stokes) is set to 5-10


Further output of the model
===========================

When the fit is finished the XSPEC command XSET can be used to see the following
additional information of the model:
 
* **Theta_degrees**
  - the true half-opening angle Theta converted to degrees measured from the rotation axis
* **inc_degrees**
  - inclination in degrees measured from the rotation axis, i.e. "acos(cos_incl)/PI*180."
* **L**
  - if one re-enters the current normalization value as XSET variable "NORMVAL" and
    the distance to the source in Mpc as XSET variable "D_MPC", then the model provides
    an estimate of the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity L in erg/s, using
    L_X = abs(xi0) * n_H0 * (rho_in)^2 = abs(xi0) * NORMVAL * (D_MPC)^2 * (pc/cm)^2 * 1e11
* **rho_in_pc**
  - if one re-enters the current normalization value as XSET variable "NORMVAL", if one
    specifies the distance to the source in Mpc as XSET variable "D_MPC", and if one
    specifies the expected density at the inner edge of the torus in cm^{-3} as XSET
    variable "NH0", then the model provides the distance rho_in between the torus and
    the center in pc
* **rho_in_r_g**
  - if one additionally specifies the central object's mass as XSET variable "MASS", then
    the model provides the distance rho_in between the torus and the center in r_g = GM/c^2
* **RF**
  - reflection fraction: the ratio of the reflected and total (primary + reflected)
    energy-flux in the used model energy range


Required files
==============

* **Source code files**
  - xsstokes_torus.c
  - lmodel-sttorus.dat
* **reprocessing tables**
  (must be stored in a directory called "tables", for reprocessing of photons in distant
  opaque toroidal structure, more details in Podgorný J. et al. (2024), Podgorný J. (2025))
  - [32287626.zip](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.32287626)
* **Theta limit functions**
  - visbility_line.txt
  - visbility_line_c.txt


Installation and usage in XSPEC
===============================

1. **Download the source code files**
   into a directory where you want to install the model, e.g. '/path/to/stokes_torus-master/'

2. **Download the reprocessing tables in FITS files**
   [32287626.zip](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.32287626)
   with the tables in a directory called "tables" within the directory with stokes_torus,
   i.e. '/path/to/stokes_torus-master/tables'; not all tables are required if one uses only
   part of the parameter space (see above)

3. **Unzip the reflection tables** with polarisation information, e.g. by the command:

   `unzip 32287626.zip`
   
4. **Compile the code** inside XSPEC (needed to be done only once):

   The code is compiled inside XSPEC with the following command (assuming all 
   the source files and FITS tables inside a subdirectory "tables" are in the directory
   '/path/to/stokes_torus-master'):

   `initpackage sttorus lmodel-sttorus.dat /path/to/stokes_torus-master`

   **Note**:
   Your XSPEC installation must have been originally installed from the source 
   code distribution. Local models, like stokes_torus, cannot be used if the XSPEC
   was originally installed from the pre-compiled binary distribution.

5. **Load the stokes_torus model** into XSPEC:

   To use the stokes_torus model inside XSPEC, first the model package needs to be
   loaded and also setup a directory containing the stokes_torus set:

   `lmod sttorus /path/to/stokes_torus-master`
   `xset XSDIR /path/to/stokes_torus-master`

6. Then the **stokes_torus model may be used** in the usual way, e.g.:

   `mo sttorus`

   **Note**:
   In case of segmentation fault, one may need to increase the stack size before 
   launching XSPEC, e.g. with the command:

   `ulimit -s unlimited`

   or 

   `ulimit -s 65532`



Viewing the model in XSPEC
==========================

One usually needs to have polarisation data sets loaded for all three stokes
parameters to view the polarisation properties predicted by a model inside XSPEC.
The model is then shown in the energy range covered by, and with the energy binning
of, these data sets. To overcome these disadvantages, the stokes_torus model provides
a parameter (par12) that defines the output of the model, e.g. to show the model
prediction for the polarisation degree, one needs to set par12 to 5, see Section
[Model parameters](#model-parameters). In this case, dummy response may be used
without any data loaded, e.g. `'dummyrsp 0.1 100. 300 log'`. Then the model may be
viewed (after it has been loaded in XSPEC) in a usual way using `'plot model'`. Note
that when showing polarisation degree, angle and normalised Stokes parameters, i.e.
when par12 is set to 5-10, the normalisation of the model needs to be set to unity.

To use the original way of showing results of polarisation model inside XSPEC, we
also provide a fake null data sets for all three Stokes parameters, i, q and u,
binned in 300 channels, together with corresponding unit response matrices, rmf, arf
and mrf, defined in 0.1 to 100 keV in 300 channels, see
[fake_null_iqu_300ch.tar.gz](https://owncloud.asu.cas.cz/index.php/s/Flk6cwYLISmw0D5).
One can see the model predicted polarisation properties in the following way:

1. **Download the package containing the fake null data and unit repsonses** -
   [fake_null_iqu_300ch.tar.gz](https://owncloud.asu.cas.cz/index.php/s/Flk6cwYLISmw0D5)

2. **Uncompress the package**, e.g. by the command:

   `tar -xzf fake_null_iqu_300ch.tar.gz`

   This will uncompress the following files:

   - `fake_null_i_300ch.pha`
   - `fake_null_q_300ch.pha`
   - `fake_null_u_300ch.pha`
   - `fake_unit_response_0.1-100keV_300ch.rmf`
   - `fake_unit_response_0.1-100keV_300ch.arf`
   - `fake_unit_response_0.1-100keV_300ch.mrf`

3. **Load the fake null data into XSPEC**:

   `data 1 fake_null_i_300ch.pha`  
   `data 2 fake_null_q_300ch.pha`  
   `data 3 fake_null_u_300ch.pha`  
   `setplot energy`  

   the fake unit responses will be automatically loaded. For convenience, change also the energy range of the data

   `ignore *:**-0.105`

4. **Set stokes_torus par12 to -1**

   To be able to use the traditional way of using the polarisation data with the model in XSPEC, one needs to set the stokes_torus parameter par12 to -1:

   `newpar 12 -1 -1 -1 -1 10 10`

   Here, we have also redefined the boundaries of this parameter in case -1 value is not allowed by the default settings.

5. **View the polarisation degree and angle** in XSPEC:

   `plot polfrac`  
   `plot polangle`  

   Note that the model has to be loaded into XSPEC first, as described in Section
   [Installation and usage in XSPEC](#installation-and-usage-in-xspec).
